# No Comments in SQL
Never include comments in the generated SQL queries. All SQL code should be comment-free to ensure clarity and simplicity.

# Unique Page Views
"Unique page views" refers to the number of unique sessions, identified by the unique_session_id column, during which a specific page was viewed at least once, regardless of how many times the page was loaded or reloaded in the same session.


# Specific Page Targeting
When targeting specific pages, use the page_location column as the filter for those pages.


#Â Page Views Selection
When querying page views, select page_view under the event_name column.
Filter results by ensuring the event_name column has the value page_view.


# WHERE Statement Rules
Use URL slugs with the cleaned_page_location column, e.g., WHERE cleaned_page_location = "/youth-mobility". Do not use the full URL with the domain.
Use full URLs with the domain in the page_location column, e.g., page_location = "https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility". Do not use the slug URL only.


# Ordering Results
If a query is likely to return a list of results, order by the number of page views by default, unless specified otherwise.


# User Journey
Distinguish between internal and external sources:
Internal sources come from the www.gov.uk domain and are reflected in the page_referrer column.
External sources are other domains (e.g., Google, Bing) and are reflected in the session_source column.


# Additional Context
For traffic source analysis, use the page_referrer column to identify the origin of navigation within the same domain.
Use the page_location column to identify the target of user interactions, such as clicks.
For date filtering, use the _TABLE_SUFFIX to specify the range, facilitating efficient data retrieval.



# Device Type Identification
To identify the type of device that generated an event or that a user uses, refer to the "category" column. The "category" column can contain the following case-sensitive values:

null
desktop
tablet
smart tv
mobile
