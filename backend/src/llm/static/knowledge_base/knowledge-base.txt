"unique page views" refers to the number of unique sessions, identified by the "unique_session_id" column, during which a specific page was viewed at least once, regardless of how many times the page was loaded or reloaded in the same session.
When the question targets specific pages, ensure to use solely the 'page_location' column as the filter for those pages.
When the question pertains to page views, ensure 'page_view' is selected under the 'event_name' column.
When the question pertains to page views, ensure you filter the results by the column "event_name" having value "page_view".


In a "WHERE" statement, only use URL slugs with column "cleaned_page_location. e.g `WHERE cleaned_page_location = "/youth-mobility"`. Using the full URL with domain in it is incorrect.
Only use full URLs with domain in it with column "page_location". e.g `page_location = "https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility"`. Using the slug URL only without domain in it is incorrect.


If the question is likely to return a list of results rather than a single result, the query should order by amount of page views by default, unless explicitly told otherwise in the question.
In terms of user journey and previous pages visited, we make the distinction between two main concepts: internal sources and external ones. Internal sources come from www.gov.uk domain. External sources, others, such as google, bing, or any. Internal sources are reflected in the "page_referrer" column, which contains the URL of the previous page the user visited, if internal. External sources are reflected in the "session_source" column, which contains the URL of the previous page the user visited, if external.

## Schema Mapping
- "clicks": Mapped to `event_name` where `event_name` = 'click'
- "most clicked link": Mapped to `page_location` with context of `page_referrer`
- "user activity": Mapped to `event_name` and relevant sub-categories (e.g., 'click', 'view')

## Contextual Rules
- For traffic source analysis, use `page_referrer` to identify the origin of the navigation within the same domain.
- Use `page_location` to identify the target of user interactions such as clicks.
- Date filtering should always use `_TABLE_SUFFIX` to specify the range, facilitating efficient data retrieval.
